# OpenGL Robotic Skeletal System Project
This project involves creating a skeletal system using OpenGL, allowing various interactions like walking, kicking, and a moon walk simulation triggered by specific key presses.

## Features
* Walking: Press 'W' to simulate the skeletal system walking.
* Kicking: Press 'K' to simulate the skeletal system kicking.
* Moon Walk: Press 'M' to simulate a moon walk motion.
## Additional Files
* Python CSV Generator Files: These files aid in generating necessary csv file for the main code.
* Music File (dangerous.wav): A music file (dangerous.wav) is used to play a song during the moon walk simulation.
## Usage
Ensure you have the required dependencies and libraries for OpenGL installed.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile and run the main code file to experience the skeletal system interactions.
Use the specified keys ('W', 'K', 'M') to trigger various motions of the skeletal system.
